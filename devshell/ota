### do a system OTA

## usage: fx ota [-d|--device <device_address>] [-h|--help]
##
## Ask the target to do an OTA. The target will use any update server available
## to it to do the update. This requires the target have a update server
## available to it. The 'serve' command is typically used to make your
## development host available to the target as an update server.
##
## Arguments:
##   -h|--help    Print out this message.
##   -d|--device  Fuchsia link-local name of the device. If not
##                specified, will connect to the only available
##                device on the link-local network.
