# The double indirection with target-specific aliases is a by-product of Bazel
# requiring that labels in a select clause correspond to existing packages,
# whereas some SDKs won't contain all possible architectures.
# By pointing to a target in the current package, we make Bazel happy - even
# though some of the local targets might not exist at all.
